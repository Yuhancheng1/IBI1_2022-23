The short summary
The alignment score between human and mouse sequence is 3579, and same amino acids percentage: 82.11180124223603, the alignment score between human and cat sequence is 3717, and same amino acids percentage: 85.21739130434783 and the alignment score between cat and mouse sequence is 3592,same amino acids percentage: 81.73913043478261. Due to the fact that the larger the number of results obtained from the matrix 62, the smaller the difference between the two, indicating that the racial affinity between humans and cats is the most recent among these three species. From an evolutionary perspective, this is because biologists believe that all organisms evolved from a common ancestor, and that humans and cats differentiated last in the racial affinity tree, indicating that they retained more identical gene fragments
